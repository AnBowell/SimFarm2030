# Adapted FACYNation codes.

### This is essentially the FACYNation codes but with different inputs for data. Npy files are used to input HAD-UKGrid weather data, along with ADHB crop yield data

#### This yield data is using one cultiver in 6 different regions over 8 years. The 1km weather data is averaged over a 30km square around any crop sample points.
