# Forecasting Agricultural and Crop Yield on a **Nation**al scale (FACYNation)
Repository for the FACYnation project.

This repository is a fork of [Peter Hurley's](https://github.com/DataJavelin/FACYnation) notebooks from the hack day conducted on October 17-18 2018 where we investigated the use of Bayesian inference to the problem of forecasting crop yields. This was part organised by data consultancy [DataJavelin](https://www.datajavelin.com/).

Eventually we aim to create a model that can be used to understand the impace of climate variation of crop yields. In notebook [3_Overview.ipynb](3_Overview.ipynb) I give an overview of the research plan to be conducted in the coming months.

Notebooks:

* [1_Exploratory_analysis.ipynb](1_Exploratory_analysis.ipynb) Peter Hurley gives an overview of the data present.

* [2_Bayesian_MSM.ipynb](2_Bayesian_MSM.ipynb)

* [3_Overview.ipynb](3_Overview.ipynb) Raphael Shirley summarises the previous notebooks by Peter Hurley and implements a two dimensional Gaussian model.

* [4_Bayesian_MSM_SD2.ipynb](4_Bayesian_MSM_SD2.ipynb) Steven freely fits the variance and shows aggreement with an assumed value.

* [5_Growth_curve_fitting.ipynb](5_Growth_curve_fitting.ipynb) Peter implements a one dimensional Gaussian model.

* [6_Warming_impact.ipynb](6_Warming_impact.ipynb) Investigating impact of temperature increases on fitted two dimensional Gaussian model.
