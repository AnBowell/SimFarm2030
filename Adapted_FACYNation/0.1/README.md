# Adapted FACYNation codes.

## Please read Data_creation readme


### This is essentially the FACYNation codes but with different inputs for data. Npy files are used to input HAD-UKGrid weather data, along with ADHB crop yield data.

#### This yield data is using one cultiver in 6 different regions over 8 years. The 1km weather data is averaged over a 30km square around any crop sample points. 


### Notebook 1 from the FACYNation project is not needed due to it only exploring the data. Notebook 6 will not be used either as the data analysis can be made from scratch.

#### The code to sample the weather data currently uses manual long/lat inputs as they have to be calculated by hand from the towns given by the yield data
